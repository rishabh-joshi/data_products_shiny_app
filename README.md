## What is Pricify?

- [Pricify](https://rishabhjoshi.shinyapps.io/pricify/) is a web based application that uses a prediction algorithm to calculate the price of your car.

- [Pricify](https://rishabhjoshi.shinyapps.io/pricify/) lets you weigh different features of your dream car, from very basic (for the layman) to technical (for the experts).

- [Pricify](https://rishabhjoshi.shinyapps.io/pricify/) makes use of a linear model to predict the price of a basic, mid-range, and premium version of the vehicle.

## How do you operate Pricify?

- [Pricify](https://rishabhjoshi.shinyapps.io/pricify/) is designed to be used by the general public and does not require any technical expertise.

- The application starts off with all the required fields initialized to their most common values.

- The user can enter the basic and intermediate details about their car. The more experienced and knowledgable user can alter the technical details to get the price estimate of their car.

- The user will enter all of the following details about their desired car.
	- Is the car company of non-USA or USA origins (Yes/No)
	- Type of the car ("Small", "Sporty", "Compact", "Midsize", "Large" or "Van")
	- Manual Transmission (Yes/No)
	- Airbags (none, driver only, or driver & passenger)
	- MPG in the city (City miles per US gallon by EPA rating)
	- Drivetrain type (rear wheel, front wheel or 4WD)
	- Number of cylinders
	- Horsepower (maximum horsepower)
	- Size of the Engine (litres)

- [Pricify](https://rishabhjoshi.shinyapps.io/pricify/) will then show you what a basic, mid-range, and a premium model of a car will cost based on your specifiactions.
